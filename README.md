# COP3503_Term_Project
The semester long team project for the Fall 2017 semester of COP 3503 at the University of Florida.

The code is compartmentalized into separate development modules. Each module is housed under one of the subfolders, with the except of obj and .settings. obj is used for building the project, and .settings is used to hold the eclipse settings for the project.

main.cpp is in the root of the project, and links the core components of the project together. It contains int main(), and is the point the code executes from.

To build this project, Simply run make in the root of the project tree. It has been tested to be compatible with Ubuntu Linux.
To run the build program, execute the AppointmentManager file that is created after running make.

You'll need a copy of gcc and g++ on your machine to compile this project.
